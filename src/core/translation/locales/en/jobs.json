Led by the inspiring vision of Harry Peterson, we develop innovative solutions and provide educational resources, engage in community dialogues, and support sustainable practices. Together, we envision a future where marine areas are not just protected but revered, setting a global benchmark for conservation."

I have experience with a variety of design processes, and I am confident in my ability to design products that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional. I am also experienced in creating prototypes and presenting my designs to clients and stakeholders. Most importantly, I am passionate about designing products that improve peopleâs lives. I am always looking for ways to simplify and improve the user experience, and I firmly believe that good design should be accessible to everyone. I am excited to join Ocean Protection and continue working on products that make a difference in peopleâs lives. Thank you for your time and consideration.
